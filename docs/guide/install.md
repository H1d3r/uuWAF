# Installation
UUSEC WAF supports one click fully automatic installation (for Ubuntu or Debian systems, please use Docker version), without the need for manual intervention, providing you with the ultimate experience.



## ‚ô®Ô∏èRequirements <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
?> The UUSEC WAF has extremely low requirements for configuration, as detailed below:

  ```
  - CPU: 64 bit 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.
  - Memory: not less than 2GB
  - Disk space: not less than 8GB
  ```


## üöÄOne click installation <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
?> The installation of the UUSEC WAF is very simple, usually completed within a few minutes, and the specific time depends on the network download situation.

!> Attention: Please try to choose a pure Linux x86_64 environment server for installation, as the installation process will uninstall the old MySQL database and reinstall it. If there is no backup, it may cause the loss of old MySQL data. In addition, the UUSEC WAF adopts cloud WAF reverse proxy mode, which requires the use of ports 80 and 443 by default.

**The host version installation:**

- System requirements: RHEL 7 and above are compatible with x86_64 systems, such as Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, etc.

```bash
sudo yum install -y ca-certificates
curl https://uuwaf.uusec.com/waf-install -o waf-install && sudo bash ./waf-install && rm -f ./waf-install
```

?> After successful installation, it will display "Congratulations, successful installation".

The uninstallation method for the host version is as follows:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop uuwaf && sudo /uuwaf/waf-service -s uninstall && sudo rm -rf /uuwaf
sudo rpm -qa | grep -ie ^percona | xargs yum -y erase
```

**The docker version installation:** 

- Software dependencies: Docker version 20.10.14 or above, Docker Compose version 2.0.0 or above, lower versions may cause SQL data to be unable to be imported, resulting in login issues in the UUSEC WAF management.

If you encounter the inability to automatically install Docker Engine, please install it manually.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://uuwaf.uusec.com/waf.tgz -o waf.tgz && tar -zxf waf.tgz && sudo bash ./waf/uuwaf.sh
```

Subsequently, `bash ./waf/uuwaf.sh` is used to manage the UUSEC WAF container, including starting, stopping, updating, uninstalling, etc.

**Quick Start:**

1. Login to the management: Access https://ip:4443 ,the IP address is the server IP address for installing the UUSEC WAF, the default username is "admin", and the default password is "Passw0rd!".
2. Add a site: Go to the "Sites" menu, click the "Add Site" button, and follow the prompts to add the site domain name and website server IP.
3. Add SSL certificate: Go to the certificate management menu, click the "Add Certificate" button, and upload the HTTPS certificate and private key file of the domain name. If you do not add an SSL certificate, the UUSEC WAF will automatically attempt to apply for a Let's Encrypt free SSL certificate and renew it automatically before the certificate expires.
4. Change the DNS address of the domain: Go to the domain name service provider's management backend and change the IP address recorded in the DNS A of the domain name to the IP address of the UUSEC WAF server.
5. Test connectivity: Visit the site domain to see if the website can be opened, and check if the returned HTTP header server field is uuWAF.
